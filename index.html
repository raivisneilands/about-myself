            <p class="aboutMe">
                My name is Raivis and I am 21 years old. I am from Latvia, but currently I am studying in ERASMUS programme in Debrecen, Hungary. I knew that I wanted to associate my career with computers when I was in 8th grade when I was introduced to programming. At first I had no idea what I was looking at, but now I would say that I have a better understanding of programming and what it is.

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>In my free time I like to play sports. For example I like to play football, basketball and volleyball. I started playing these sports when I was 10 years old. And every chance I got to play one of these sports, I went and played. But I like to play football most often and most seriously.</p>

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>In my free time I also like to play videogames. I have played a lot of videogames. This list includes Grand Theft Auto, Need For Speed. Sport games like FIFA or NBA 2K are my favourite type of games. Some times, when I am playing videogames, I can lose track of time and play for hours. And if I play for hours, then I forget about my chores and things I had to do before starting to play videogames.</p>

                    <h3>Technologies</h3>
                    <p>I like to follow up with newest technologies. I find newest technologies very fascinating. The robotics and AI has come very far. Like the gap from first man flight and traveling to the Moon is only 66 years. If we take into consideration that the Earth is approximetaly 4.5 billion years old, then that is very, very fast, because the first flight was only 36.5 meters high, but 66 years later we went and flied up 384 000 kilometers. And this is only one part of technologies. Other big part is artificial intelligence or AI. These days AI is so advanced that it is possible for it to do everyday tasks, like vacuuming, doing dishes, doing calculations and so on</p>

                    <h3>Cars</h3>
                    <p>Cars are important part of our lives. Cars impact some people more than other people. Some people like cars more than others. For me I like cars. I have a car of my own that I really like to drive. The car is nothing special but it still is my car. I find fascinating that if you put bunch of metal on four pieces of rubber and you get a creation like a car.</p>

                    <p>I can not even imagine what would it be like to travel all around the world and experience all of the cultures the world can offer you. I have not traveled anywhere yet. But I would really like to. To climb a mountain. To go on road trips with friends or family</p>

            <h2>Main Goal: Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
                My ultimate goal is to become a successful software engineer. I am passionate about technology and enjoy solving complex problems through coding even though I can not really do that yet, but that is why I am studying. I aspire to work in a dynamic environment where I can contribute to innovative projects and develop cutting-edge software solutions. To achieve this goal, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in programming, software development, and related areas. I am eager to embark on this journey and make a meaningful impact in the field of software engineering.
            </p>
            <h2>Side Goal: Social Life</h2>
            <p>
                And bonus to becoming software engineer I also would like to meet a lot of people in my journey. People who would help me in any way they can. At the moment I have met a lot of people who has helped me on my way. But I would like to meet more.
